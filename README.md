# Modelling and Analysis of Physiological Systems

Welcome to the repository containing coursework and simulations for the **BM2012 - Modelling and Analysis of Physiological Systems** module.

This repository features MATLAB-based simulations and LaTeX-based documentation that analyze and model core physiological processes. Some simulations were built upon **pre-existing models**, adapted for academic use and further analysis.
