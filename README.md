# Modelling and Analysis of Physiological Systems

Welcome to the repository for my course assignments in **Modelling and Analysis of Physiological Systems**.  
This repo includes MATLAB simulations and reports related to modeling various physiological processes like lung mechanics and neuronal signal transmission.

## Contents

- **Lung Ventilation Simulations:**
  - Healthy lung modeling
  - Pulmonary fibrosis simulation
  - Asthma (obstructive condition) simulation
  - Analysis of minute ventilation across different conditions

- **Neuronal Modeling:**
  - Electrical modeling of dendritic branches
  - Interpretation of membrane potential changes across impedances


## Technologies Used

- MATLAB (for simulations and parameter setting)
- LaTeX (for documentation and reports)

## Folder Structure
- Simulation of respiratory mechanics
- Electrical properties of branching dendrites
